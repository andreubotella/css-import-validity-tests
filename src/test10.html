        The contents of the <style> element are passed to the CSS parser as a
        stream of code points, not bytes, so the @charset rule is not processed.

      If the small characters above are not <b>&Eacute;&trade;</b>, you're
      saving the HTML with a UTF-8 BOM.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the large character above is <b>&#x259;</b>, the
      <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element's contents are being sent to the CSS
      parser as a byte stream. This shouldn't happen.

    <p>If this background is pink, the @import rule is going through.</p>
